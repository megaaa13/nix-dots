# Nix-dots

Hey there !
Here is my current NixOS configuration.
It is SecureBoot ready, but will require a little by hand config to make it work. [Here](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/blob/master/docs/QUICK_START.md) are the steps.

I'm totally new to nix, so it's far from perfect !

Feel free to tell me about any improvement that you could think of !
